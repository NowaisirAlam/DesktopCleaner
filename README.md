#  Desktop Cleaner — Automated File Organizer (Python)

DesktopCleaner is a lightweight Python tool that automatically organizes and sorts files on your desktop.  
It monitors your desktop folder in real time and moves files (images, documents, videos, audio, zips, etc.) into categorized folders.

This keeps your desktop clean, organized, and clutter-free — automatically.
